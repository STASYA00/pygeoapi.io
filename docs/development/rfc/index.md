# Request for Comments (RFC)

An RFC is a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. It is submitted either for peer review or simply to convey new concepts, information, or (occasionally) engineering humor.

An RFC describes a major change in the technological underpinnings of
pygeoapi, major additions to functionality, or changes in the direction of
the project.
