## Summary

This RFC outlines pygeoapi policy on upstream dependency management, development and stable branch workflow.

## Background

Having [started in 2018](https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi/commit/17edb346a177c9cfdb1d4a7494a029c9e64ed89e), a core goal of pygeoapi was to develop and provide an OGC API server that is light on core dependencies.  Since then, the project has experienced considerable success in the number of features implemented and standards supported.  A reality of the aforementioned has been the addition of numerous dependencies that have impacted the codebase on various operating systems and environments.

pygeoapi is currently provided for the below:

- UbuntuGIS
- pip3
- Docker
- Conda
- FreeBSD

Operating systems and build systems are managed on schedules and timelines that are driven by project requirements.  As a result, various differences in dependencies and requirements arise.  This is especially evident when adding features based on new packages that are available on some environments but not others.

Given the above, it is critical that pygeoapi establish a dependency policy in order to manage development.

## Dependency policy

### `master` branch

master branch dependencies and requirements shall be consistent against a given operating system baseline:

* Ubuntu dependencies
* pip3 requirements
* Docker / Docker Compose

### Stable branches

On a major or minor release, pygeoapi will implement a stable branch which is pinned to the dependencies at the time of release against master.

Fixes will be made and backported to stable branches as required.  For security fixes, stable branch dependencies shall be updated as required.

### Adding new dependencies

Careful consideration shall be given when new dependencies are proposed.  New dependencies represent long term commitment and maintenance to dependency management and stability of pygeoapi.

## Bootstrapping

To bootstrap this RFC, the following baseline is proposed:

* master branch shall be compatible to dependences available on Ubuntu 22.04

## Voting History

TBD
