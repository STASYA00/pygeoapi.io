## Summary

This RFC describes the policies and procedures for handling pygeoapi GitHub Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).

## Issue and PR management

From a software management perspective, the pygeoapi project is managed on GitHub, which includes the following:

- source code / version control (software, documentation)
- Issues (bugs, feature enhancements, etc), milestones and triage
- Pull Requests
- wiki
- milestones

Given the free and open-source nature and spirit of the project, contributions are enabled and encouraged.  To
efficiently manage the above elements in the context of the pygeoapi PSC, committers and collaborators,
it is proposed to put forth clear principles for handling GitHub contributions.

## Key principles

- contributions to (new features, bugs, documentation, testing) are encouraged and greatly appreciated
- non-trivial contributions in the form of Pull Requests are best put forth in the context of an Issue, so that discussion
  can take place to identify any possible concerns or impacts
- pygeoapi PSC, committers and collaborators are able to triage and collaborate on Issues and Pull Requests in a timely
  fashion
- over time, it is normal that Issues may be without activity for any given reason

## Implementation

To efficiently manage pygeoapi Issues and Pull Requests and to maintain a healthy and sustainable enviroment for pygeoapi
PSC, committers and collaborators, the following implementation is proposed:

- all Issues and Pull Requests shall be at least addressed (triaged or commented on) within ten (10) business days (assuming working days Monday - Friday)
- Issues or Pull Requests with more than ninety (90) days of inactivity shall receive an automated update to the Issue with a warning that the Issue or Pull Request will be automatically closed in 7 days
    - Issues with a label of `blocker` shall not be closed under any circumstance
    - automated updates shall be run on a weekly basis
- GitHub Issue Templates shall be updated as follows:
    - reminding the submitter that the Issue or Pull Request is subject to the above policies and procedures
    - encouraging and guiding the submitter that a given Pull Request should be based on an Issue
